this sample's data is from two sources
- Honglue Eppendorf - originally dsA6DNA m1A16 at pH 6.8, which was dissolved in pH 4.4 HS NB, and then melted
- Honglue NMR tube - originally at pH 6.8, diluted out of tube at pH 5.4 NB, then buffer exchanged to pH 4.4 HS NB, and then melted
thus, it is likely that NMR sample which was obtained from Waj, was also from Midland
