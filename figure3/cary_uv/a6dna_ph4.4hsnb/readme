concentrated stock in water
sample is good based on pH 6.8 measurements


# pH 4.4HS buffer is good!
run8, run9 - from 20201223_pH4p4HSStock_testing.csv - shape looks good, fit value too
runn10 - from 20201228_melting.csv
run11 - from 20201228_melting1.csv
run12 - from 20200108_melting4 - to test whether probe1 in block1, sample in block2 would give good data
- this is slightly off relative to probe 1, sample 1
- however, we can correct for this, by assuming that offset is temperature independent between both probes, and then the thermodynamic parameters match
- that from dick and (probe+sample in chamber1). 

run13 - new stock 4.4hsnb (buffer in old falcon)
run14 - new stock 4.4hsnb (buffer in old falcon)
run15 - new stock 4.4hsnb (buffer in new falcon)
run16 - new2* stock 4.4hsnb (buffer in new2* falcon)
